## Implementation of PixelCNN and its different variants in PyTorch 
Based on Assignment 1 of <a href = "https://sites.google.com/view/berkeley-cs294-158-sp20/home"> CS294</a> Deep Unsupervised Learning Course. 
The ipython notebooks contain the following implementations of PixelCNN:
1. PixelCNN : For GrayScale Images without class conditioning (eg. MNIST Dataset)
2. PixelCNN with class conditioning
3. Conditional PixelCNN 
4. Gated PixelCNN
